# Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
## Project Overview
Welcome to my latest project focused on predicting car prices using machine learning techniques. This project is aimed at providing valuable insights and predictive models to assist automotive professionals, enthusiasts, and consumers in making informed decisions.

## Key Features
### Data Exploration & Preprocessing
- Cleaned and transformed the dataset to prepare it for modeling.
- Engineered relevant features such as car age and mileage to enhance predictive accuracy.
- Employed techniques to handle missing data and categorical variables.
### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations exploring car price distributions, feature correlations, and market trends.
- Identified key factors influencing car prices through statistical analysis and visual insights.
### Machine Learning Models
- Implemented and compared multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Evaluated models using performance metrics such as R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- Selected the best-performing model based on cross-validation results and model interpretability.
### Deployment
- Developed a streamlined web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input car specifications and receive instant price predictions.
- Integrated dropdown menus for selecting car attributes such as manufacturer, model, year, fuel type, and transmission.
- Enabled visualization of predicted prices and feature importance for transparency and user engagement.
### Technical Stack
- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, streamlit
